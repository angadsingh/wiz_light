# wiz_light
A Home assistant integration for WiZ Light bulbs

This is a fork of https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light/ and fixes several issues with the component. Please note that once these two PRs are merged you should use the original component as I do not aim at maintaining this one: (https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light/pull/9, https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight/pull/2)

Bug fixes:
 - Fixes https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light/issues/6: make the whole component truly async using non-blocking UDP
 - Light control now works even when lights are set to a rhythm.

Features:
 - Now supports switching the light to rhythm mode! (rhythm is defined as a scene for HA)
 - Implements a pattern of sending multiple command UDP datagrams until response is received
 - Consolidates getPilot and setPilot calls using a PilotBuilder and PilotParser. Removes unnecessary UDP calls for each and every attribute (color, temperature, brightness, scene, etc.) and makes a combined getPilot/setPilot call
 - enhanced debug logging for UDP

This component does not need a dependency on `pywizlight` like @sbidy's component

## Next improvement:
- Implement hacs.xyz structure

## Working features 
 - Brigtness
 - Color (RGB)
 - White Color Temprature
 - On/Off, Toggle
 - Effects
 - Setting a rhythm as a scene

## Testing
See `test.py` for how the underlying API works

## HA config
To enable the platform integration add 
```
light:
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: <Name of the device>
    host: <IP of the bulb>
```
